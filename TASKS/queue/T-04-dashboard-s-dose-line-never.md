## T-04 — The dashboard's dose line never renders its volume
**Priority 3/10** · **Owner:** mac · **Status:** filed

**What:** `DashboardFormat.doseLine` is a second, dead derivation of the draw volume, reading config
keys no iOS row contains — so the "· 0.25 mL" half of the next-dose card has never appeared on any
build.

**Done when:** it reads the one correct source (`DoseVolume`). Fold in only if it is a one-line
repoint; otherwise it stays here.
